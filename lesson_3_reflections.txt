When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I am not working on my own computer or if I'm working with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  As I maybe was just experimenting I just wan to pull only a particular branch

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
  When would you use one instead of another?

  forks: it's similar to clone but it acts on GitHub just to get a repository
  directrly into your own so you can make changes to it.
  clones: I use it when I want to clone a repository from a GitHub to my local
  computer and changes done locally.
  branches: if I want to make a branch that I just not sure to share it on my
  Github now.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
  stored locally?

  So I know if one of my any changes happened in my GitHub repository and
  prevent pushing directly.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  I think now every thing will be harder without GitHub ...It's amazing.
