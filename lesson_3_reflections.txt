When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I am not working on my own computer or if I'm working with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  As I maybe was just experimenting I just wan to pull only a particular branch
