What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  Just opens a new repository for my work to be tracked later, and I need
  it to make commits that will help me to keep track my work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  It is different in that it's considered as intermediate stage between both of
  the repository and the working directory.
  It's value is in it allow the repository to make to commits to separate files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
  Just by using git diff that will compare between staging area and working
  directory and the add the changes to staging area the use git diff --staged
  to compare between stageg area and the most recent commit.
