How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was great and helped me alot, if it wasn't that it would take me along time.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    That would help me alot to save time as if I haven't older versions so it
    will be hard to compare or undo any work.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    it's pros that I will choose when to make a commit and that will prevent too
    much older version, it will be clear to know what changes have been made.
    It's cons that I may be forget to commit and that will be hard to know
    changes after sometimes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think because that Git is much more desined for programmers who for sure
    will need a more than one file to work with in a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    you first use command of git log to view history of the repository then you
    use git diff to compare between to commits after coping and pasting the IDs
    of these commits you want to compare.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    will I think I won't be worried as before as I a now can access older
    versions and can solve the error faster but I am still really worried
    what will happen to the other changes I already made in the newer versions
    that I need.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try using Git for opening my text editor and show how it will
    ask for a commit.
